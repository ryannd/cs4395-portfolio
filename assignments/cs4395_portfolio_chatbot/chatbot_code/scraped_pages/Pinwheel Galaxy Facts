The Pinwheel Galaxy in the constellation Ursa Major (the Greater Bear) is a “grand design” spiral, meaning that it has well-defined spiral arms and dust lanes that extend all the way around the body of the galaxy. It was discovered in 1781 by astronomer Pierre Méchain, and included as object number 101 in Charles Messier’s list of celestial objects.
