Titan is the Saturn’s largest moon and is the second largest moon in our solar system. If it were not orbiting Saturn, Titan could be considered a planet as it is larger than Mercury. Titan is covered with a thick atmosphere that some consider to be similar to that of early Earth.Sources:Image – http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/cassini/multimedia/gallery-indexTitan.htmlProfile – http://solarsystem.nasa.gov/planets/titan, http://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/planetary/factsheet/saturniansatfact.html
