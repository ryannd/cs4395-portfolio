the antennae is a pair of spiral galaxies that are interacting and mingling their stars.
they began their galactic dance over a few hundred million years ago and are currently in a period where their colliding gas clouds are bursting with new star formation.
as the two galaxies merge, their gravitational interactions pull long tails of gas away from each other, and these tails are the sites of starburst activity.
in a few billion years, the cores of these two galaxies will be combined into one large core, with a supermassive black hole at its heart.
it will be surrounded by an elliptical galaxy of old stars.
