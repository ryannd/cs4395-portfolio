the sun is the star at the centre of our solar system.
it is an almost perfect sphere of super-hot gases whose gravity holds the solar system together.
the energy produced by the sun is essential for life on earth and is a driving force behind the earth’s weather.
sunspots are areas of the sun’s surface that appear darker than the surrounding areas, this is because they are cooler.
they form in areas of strong magnetic activity that inhibit heat transfer.
when the magnetic fields near sunspots cross, tangle or are reorganised, an explosion of energy can be released.
intense solar flares can interfere with radio communications on earth.
