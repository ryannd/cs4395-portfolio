the sombrero galaxy is one of the most unusual looking barred spiral galaxies visible from earth.
its bright nucleus, large central bulge and spiral arms threaded through with a thick dust lane make it look a little like a hat from mexico.
the dust lane is a ring that circles the bulge of the galaxy, and it is rich with gas, dust, and hydrogen gas.
because it has all the elements needed for star formation, itâ€™s not surprising that astronomers have found many sites of star formation inside.
