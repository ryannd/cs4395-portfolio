the kuiper belt (sometimes referred to as the kuiper-edgeworth belt) is an area of the outer solar system that is estimated to stretch across 20 astronomical units (au) of space.
it contains small solar system bodies made mostly of ices.
the ices are frozen volatiles (gases) such as methane, ammonia, nitrogen and water.
it also is home to the known dwarf planets pluto, haumea and makemake.
the kuiper-edgeworth belt is named for the astronomers gerard kuiper, who theorized about a disk of material in the outer reaches of the solar system, and kenneth edgeworth, who had the idea that the outer solar system contained a number of small bodies, perhaps left over from the formation of the sun and planets.
this region of space is cold enough to support the existence of volatiles more easily than areas closer to the sun.
the kuiper belt extends from roughly the orbit of neptune (at 30 au out to about 55 astronomical units from the sun.
the main body of this belt covers much of this region, ranging from nearly 40 au to 48 au.
it is thick in most places and astronomers have described it as being more torus-shaped than a belt would be.
other regions of the kuiper belt include a disk of scattered objects that are part of a population of worlds called trans-neptunian objects.
