with the exception of ceres, which is located in the asteroid belt, the other dwarf planets are found in the outer solar system.
ceres is the closest dwarf planet to the sun and is located in the asteroid belt, between mars and jupiter, making it the only dwarf planet in the inner solar system.
what other fascinating things do we know about the asteroid belt?
they form the asteroid belt.
the four largest asteroids in the belt are ceres, vesta, pallas, and hygiea.
they contain half the mass of the entire belt.
the asteroid belt is located in an area of space between the orbits of mars and jupiter.
the belt is about 1 au thick.
the average distance between objects in the asteroid belt is quite large.
the kuiper belt (sometimes referred to as the kuiper-edgeworth belt) is an area of the outer solar system that is estimated to stretch across 20 astronomical units (au) of space.
the kuiper-edgeworth belt is named for the astronomers gerard kuiper, who theorized about a disk of material in the outer reaches of the solar system, and kenneth edgeworth, who had the idea that the outer solar system contained a number of small bodies, perhaps left over from the formation of the sun and planets.
the kuiper belt extends from roughly the orbit of neptune (at 30 au out to about 55 astronomical units from the sun.
the main body of this belt covers much of this region, ranging from nearly 40 au to 48 au.
it is thick in most places and astronomers have described it as being more torus-shaped than a belt would be.
other regions of the kuiper belt include a disk of scattered objects that are part of a population of worlds called trans-neptunian objects.
the oort cloud is a theorised shell of icy objects that lie beyond the kuiper belt, as such the facts detailed on this page are hypothetical.
comets normally orbit the sun, and have their origins in the oort cloud and kuiper belt regions of the outer solar system.
