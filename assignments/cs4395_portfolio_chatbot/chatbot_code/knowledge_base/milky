the oort cloud is very distant from the sun and it can be disrupted by the nearby passage of a star, nebula, or by actions in the disk of the milky way.
the milky way galaxy is our home galaxy in the universe.
the milky way began forming around 12 billion years ago and is part of a group of about 50 galaxies called the local group.

the andromeda galaxy (m31) is the closest large galaxy to the milky way and is one of a few galaxies that can be seen unaided from the earth.
5 billion years the andromeda galaxy and the milky way are expected to collide and the result will be a giant elliptical galaxy.
the milky way is consuming gas that is flowing from the magellanic clouds (in the magellanic stream).
eventually these two smaller galaxies might collide with the milky way.
the triangulum galaxy, also known as m33, is one of the closest spiral galaxies to the milky way.
the whirlpool galaxy is a familiar one to stargazers and among the many close galaxy neighbours to our own milky way.
our milky way is a spiral, as is the rather close-by andromeda galaxy.
