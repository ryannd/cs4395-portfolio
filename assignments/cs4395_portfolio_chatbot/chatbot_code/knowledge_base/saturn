there are 8 planets in our solar system, they are mercury, venus, earth, mars, jupiter, saturn, uranus and neptune.
click on any planet below to find out more about it: the order of the planets from closest to the sun outwards is; mercury, venus, earth, mars, jupiter, saturn, uranus and finally neptune.
the largest planet in the solar system is jupiter, followed by saturn, uranus, neptune, earth, venus, mars with the smallest being mercury.
the four gas giants in our solar system are jupiter, saturn, uranus, and neptune.
the largest ring system in the solar system is the one around saturn.
best known for its fabulous ring system, saturn is the sixth planet from the sun and the second largest in our solar system.
like jupiter, saturn is a gas giant and is composed of similar gasses including hydrogen, helium and methane.
while all the gas giants in our solar system have rings none of them are as extensive or distinctive as saturn’s.
the first ‘up close’ view of the rings were by pioneer 11 spacecraft which flew by saturn on september 1, 1971. saturn’s rings are made up of are billions of particles that range in size from tiny dust grains to objects as large as mountains.
saturn’s rings are divided into 7 groups, named alphabetically in the order of their discovery (outwards from saturn; d, c, b, a, f, g and e).
the f ring is kept in place by two of saturn’s moons, prometheus and pandora, these are referred to as ‘shepherd moons’.
saturn’s atmosphere is composed primarily of hydrogen (96%) and helium (3%) with traces of other substances like methane, ammonia, acetylene, ethane, propane and phosphine.

the first of saturn’s moons to be observed was titan in 1655 by christiaan huygens, another moon was not found until 1671 when giovanni domenico cassini discovered iapetus.
two of saturn’s moons (janus & epimetheus) swap orbits every 4 years.
enceladus is the sixth-largest moon of saturn and, after titan, one of the most-studied worlds in the system.

rhea is saturn’s second largest moon and is the ninth largest moon in the solar system.
rhea was discovered in 1672 by giovanni domenico cassini and was the third of saturn’s moons to be found.

titan is the saturn’s largest moon and is the second largest moon in our solar system.
if it were not orbiting saturn, titan could be considered a planet as it is larger than mercury.
