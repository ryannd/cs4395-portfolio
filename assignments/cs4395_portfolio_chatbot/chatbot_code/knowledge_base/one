find out more about the outer planets by selecting one below.
an ice giant planet is one that is at least ten times the mass of earth, and contains a higher percentage of what planetary scientists refer to as “ices”.
the largest ring system in the solar system is the one around saturn.
jupiter, uranus and neptune also have rings, and at least one asteroid is known to have a small ring as well.
however, it is unknown whether this is the same red spot that we see today, or whether jupiter has had many such storms that have come and gone.

while all the gas giants in our solar system have rings none of them are as extensive or distinctive as saturn’s.
the first ‘up close’ view of the rings were by pioneer 11 spacecraft which flew by saturn on september 1, 1971. saturn’s rings are made up of are billions of particles that range in size from tiny dust grains to objects as large as mountains.

dwarf planets share many of the same characteristics as planets though there is one significant difference.
discovered in 1930, pluto is the second closest dwarf planet to the sun and was at one point classified as the ninth planet.

makemake was discovered on march 31st 2005 and was recognized as a dwarf planet by the international astronomical union (iau) in july 2008. until april 2016 makemake was thought to be the only one of the four outer dwarf planets to not have any moons.
eris is the second largest dwarf planet (very a close second to pluto) and at one point was considered for the position of the 10th planet.

in a total solar eclipse, the narrowest part of the path (where the sun is completely blocked and the moon casts its darkest shadow (called the umbra)) is called the “zone of totality”.
not every solar eclipse is a total one.
if you could stand on an asteroid and look around, the next one would be too far away to see very well.
the process of collision and impact continues to this day, although with smaller objects (since all the larger ones became the planets we know).
a larger one could rain very large pieces down on the surface or into the oceans.
if a comet is independently discovered by three people named smith, jones, and petersen, it could also be called comet smith-jones-petersen, in addition to its formal designation.
it has become one of the most-studied meteorites of all time, and is an excellent example of a carbonaceous chondrite.
the fukang meteorite is one of the best examples of a pallasite, a type of stony-iron meteorite.
it is a very large, 60-tone rock, which makes it nearly impossible to move.
it has been declared a national monument in namibia, and is one of the rare meteorites that is also part of a tourist site.
the leonid meteor shower can be a very busy one.
a galaxy is a massive, gravitationally bound system that consists of stars, stellar objects (such as brown dwarfs and neutron stars), nebulae, an interstellar medium of gas and dust, black holes, and an unknown component of dark matter.
find out more about one of the galaxies by selecting it below.
it is a fairly typical barred spiral with four major arms in its disk, at least one spur, and a newly discovered outer arm.
the galactic centre, which is located about 26, 000 light-years from earth, contains at least one supermassive black hole (called sagittarius a*), and is crossed by a bar.
the andromeda galaxy (m31) is the closest large galaxy to the milky way and is one of a few galaxies that can be seen unaided from the earth.
in a few billion years, the cores of these two galaxies will be combined into one large core, with a supermassive black hole at its heart.
the sombrero galaxy is one of the most unusual looking barred spiral galaxies visible from earth.
the triangulum galaxy, also known as m33, is one of the closest spiral galaxies to the milky way.
the whirlpool galaxy is a familiar one to stargazers and among the many close galaxy neighbours to our own milky way.
the most widely used classification scheme for galaxies is based on one devised by edwin p. hubble and further refined by astronomer gerard de vaucouleurs.
they may show some bar structure, they may have active regions of star formation, and some smaller ones are listed as “dwarf irregulars”, very similar to the very earliest galaxies that formed about 13.

the largest of these, triton was discovered by william lassell in 1846 one day after the discovery of neptune, it was more than 100 years later before a second moon was found.
the most distant moon of neptune is called neso, and orbits so far away that it takes 26 years to make one trip around the planet.
phobos is one of the two moons of mars.
europa is known for being one of the first worlds a subsurface water ocean was hypothesised for.
enceladus is the sixth-largest moon of saturn and, after titan, one of the most-studied worlds in the system.
