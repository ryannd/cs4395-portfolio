it is a shield volcano built by the continuous action of flowing lava over millions and millions of years that began some 3 billion years ago.
however, the moon’s orbit will continue to widen, and in perhaps 600 million years, total solar eclipses will no longer occur.
there are millions of them, and they are often grouped by their composition.
earth is bombarded with millions of tons of space material each day.
examples of galaxies range from dwarfs with as few as ten million stars to giants with a hundred trillion stars or more, each orbiting through their galaxy.
they began their galactic dance over a few hundred million years ago and are currently in a period where their colliding gas clouds are bursting with new star formation.
it lies 3 million light-years away, in the constellation triangulum.
5 million light-years.
ellipticals can have as few as a hundred million to perhaps a hundred trillion stars, and they can range in size from a few thousand light-years across to more than a few hundred thousand.
6 billion years ago around some 30–50 million years after the formation of the solar system.
