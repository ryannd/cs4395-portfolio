mars has two small moons, phobos and deimos.
these moons are thought to be captured asteroids and are among the smallest natural satellites in the solar system.
a ring system around a planet or asteroid is a disk made up of dust, chunks of material (ice, in the outer solar system), and small moons.
these are made up of chunks of ice and rock, believed to have come from asteroids comets or even moons, that broke apart before they reached the planet.
the f ring is kept in place by two of saturn’s moons, prometheus and pandora, these are referred to as ‘shepherd moons’.
makemake was discovered on march 31st 2005 and was recognized as a dwarf planet by the international astronomical union (iau) in july 2008. until april 2016 makemake was thought to be the only one of the four outer dwarf planets to not have any moons.
the planetary science community refers to them as minor planets, a general term applied to solar system bodies smaller than moons.
there are more than 194 moons of the various planets, dwarf planets in the solar system.
the planets mercury and venus do not have any moons and neither does the dwarf planet ceres.

the moonmars has two moons called phobos and deimos.
these moons are thought to be captured asteroids and are among the smallest natural satellites in the solar system.
phobos & deimosjupiter is swarming with at least 79 moons in orbit around it, the second largest number of natural satellites around any of the planets.
jupiter’s 4 largest moons; ganymede, callisto, io and europa are known as the galilean moons, named after their discoverer galileo galilei.
galilean moons – io, europa, ganymede & callistoinner moons – metis, adrastea, amalthea & thebeother moons – themisto, leda, himalia, lysithea, elara, s/2000 j 11, carpo, s/2003 j 12, euporie, s/2003 j 3, s/2003 j 18, s/2011 j 1, s/2010 j 2, thelxinoe, euanthe, helike, orthosie, iocaste, s/2003 j 16, praxidike, harpalyke, mneme, hermippe, thyone, ananke, herse, aitne, kale, taygete, s/2003 j 19, chaldene, s/2003 j 15, s/2003 j 10, s/2003 j 23, erinome, aoede, kallichore, kalyke, carme, callirrhoe, eurydome, s/2011 j 2, pasithee, s/2010 j 1, kore, cyllene, eukelade, s/2003 j 4, pasiphae, hegemone, arche, isonoe, s/2003 j 9, s/2003 j 5, sinope, sponde, autonoe, megaclite & s/2003 j 2saturn has at least 82 moons orbiting it, some of them inside the ring system which helps shape the rings.
they range from very tiny worlds of less than a kilometer in diameter to spherical moons such as titan.
the first of saturn’s moons to be observed was titan in 1655 by christiaan huygens, another moon was not found until 1671 when giovanni domenico cassini discovered iapetus.
two of saturn’s moons (janus & epimetheus) swap orbits every 4 years.
notable moons – titan, enceladus, iapetus, rhea, mimas, tethys & dione.

the innermost moons are similar in characteristics with the thin rings.
the five largest moons are rounded, and four of them show some kind of internal activity which shapes their surfaces.
william herschel who discovered uranus in 1781 also observed the largest two moons, titania and oberon, in 1787. notable moons – miranda, titania, ariel, umbriel & oberonother moons – cordelia, ophelia, bianca, cressida, desdemona, juliet, portia, rosalind, cupid, belinda, perdita, puck, mab, francisco, caliban, stephano, trinculo, sycorax, margaret, prospero, setebos & ferdinandneptune has at least 14 moons.
notable moons – triton, nereid & proteusother moons – naiad, thalassa, despina, galatea, larissa, s/2004 n 1, halimede, sao, laomedeia, psamathe & nesohydra, nyx, styx, and kerberos are the smaller moons of pluto.
these four moons rotate chaotically on their axes.
these moons were likely created during a giant collision, which scattered these tiny worlds into orbit around pluto and charon.
notable moon – charonother moons – nix, hydra, kerberos & styxboth of haumea’s moons were discovered in 2005 from observations made by the w. m. keck observatory.
phobos is one of the two moons of mars.
it is the larger of the two moons, and is heavily cratered and appears to have grooves and streaks of material along its sides.
deimos is the smaller of the two moons of mars.
io is the innermost and the second smallest of the four galilean moons.
europa is the smallest of jupiter’s galilean moons and the second closest, however it is still the sixth largest moon in the solar system.
it is the most distant of the galilean moons from jupiter.
rhea was discovered in 1672 by giovanni domenico cassini and was the third of saturn’s moons to be found.
