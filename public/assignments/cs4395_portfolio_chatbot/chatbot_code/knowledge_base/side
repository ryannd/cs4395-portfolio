for every two orbits of the sun, mercury completes three rotations about its axis and up until 1965 it was thought that the same side of mercury constantly faced the sun.
this is the amount of time it takes for the earth to completely rotate around its axis; astronomers call this a sidereal day.
this entire region lies over a hotspot, a place in the planet’s crust that allows magma from deep inside to flow out to the surface.
uranus is tipped over on its side with an axial tilt of 98 degrees.
it is often described as “rolling around the sun on its side.
how such powerful winds were discovered on a planet so far from the sun is still considered a mystery to this day.
eris is the second largest dwarf planet (very a close second to pluto) and at one point was considered for the position of the 10th planet.
the large magellanic cloud is a nearby galaxy once considered to be an irregular type until astronomers studied it more closely.
because it has all the elements needed for star formation, it’s not surprising that astronomers have found many sites of star formation inside.

the moon is in synchronous rotation with earth meaning the same side is always facing the earth.
it is the larger of the two moons, and is heavily cratered and appears to have grooves and streaks of material along its sides.
if it were not orbiting saturn, titan could be considered a planet as it is larger than mercury.
titan is covered with a thick atmosphere that some consider to be similar to that of early earth.
