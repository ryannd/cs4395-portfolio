it is where all of the asteroids, comets, planets, stars, solar systems and galaxies in our universe are found.
planets that orbit other stars are referred to as exoplanets.
a galaxy is a massive, gravitationally bound system that consists of stars, stellar objects (such as brown dwarfs and neutron stars), nebulae, an interstellar medium of gas and dust, black holes, and an unknown component of dark matter.
examples of galaxies range from dwarfs with as few as ten million stars to giants with a hundred trillion stars or more, each orbiting through their galaxy.
the antennae is a pair of spiral galaxies that are interacting and mingling their stars.
it will be surrounded by an elliptical galaxy of old stars.
in this age of multi-wavelength observing, the sub-classifications also include markers for such characteristics as a galaxy’s star-formation rate and age spectrum of its stars.
spirals are large rotating disks of stars and nebulae, surrounded by a shell of dark matter.
many spirals have a halo of stars and star clusters arrayed above and below the disk.
spirals that have large, bright bars of stars and material cutting across their central sections are called “barred spirals”.
most ellipticals contain older, low-mass stars, and because they lack a great deal of star-making gas and dust clouds, there is little new star formation occurring in them.
ellipticals can have as few as a hundred million to perhaps a hundred trillion stars, and they can range in size from a few thousand light-years across to more than a few hundred thousand.
there are some subgroups of ellipticals, including “dwarf ellipticals” with properties that put them somewhere between regular ellipticals and the tightly knit groups of stars called globular clusters.
