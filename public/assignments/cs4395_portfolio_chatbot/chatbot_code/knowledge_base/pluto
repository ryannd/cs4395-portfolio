the formal definition of planet, as voted on by the international astronomical union in 2006, is as follows: a planet is a celestial body thatunder this definition, pluto is not a planet, but has been deemed a dwarf planet because it has not yet cleared its orbit.
there are 5 officially recognised dwarf planets in our solar system, they are ceres, pluto, haumea, makemake and eris.
there are another 6 objects in our solar system that are almost certainly dwarf planets and there may as many as 10, 000. of the dwarf planets only 2 have been visited by space probes, in 2015 nasa’s dawn and new horizons missions reached ceres and pluto respectively.
the largest dwarf planet in the solar system is pluto followed by eris, makemake, haumea, with the smallest being ceres.
the order of the dwarf planets from closest to sun outwards is ceres, pluto, haumea, makemake, with eris being the furthest from the sun.
discovered in 1930, pluto is the second closest dwarf planet to the sun and was at one point classified as the ninth planet.
pluto is the largest dwarf planet but only the second most massive, with eris being the most massive.

eris is the second largest dwarf planet (very a close second to pluto) and at one point was considered for the position of the 10th planet.
it also is home to the known dwarf planets pluto, haumea and makemake.
notable moons – triton, nereid & proteusother moons – naiad, thalassa, despina, galatea, larissa, s/2004 n 1, halimede, sao, laomedeia, psamathe & nesohydra, nyx, styx, and kerberos are the smaller moons of pluto.
these moons were likely created during a giant collision, which scattered these tiny worlds into orbit around pluto and charon.
