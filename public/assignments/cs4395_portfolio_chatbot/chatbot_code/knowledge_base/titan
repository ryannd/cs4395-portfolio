the abundances of precious metals such as nickel, iron, and titanium (to name a few), and water make asteroids an attractive target for mining operations when humans decide to expand their presence through interplanetary space.
they range from very tiny worlds of less than a kilometer in diameter to spherical moons such as titan.
the first of saturn’s moons to be observed was titan in 1655 by christiaan huygens, another moon was not found until 1671 when giovanni domenico cassini discovered iapetus.
notable moons – titan, enceladus, iapetus, rhea, mimas, tethys & dione.
the five largest are puck, miranda, ariel, umbriel, titania, and oberon.
william herschel who discovered uranus in 1781 also observed the largest two moons, titania and oberon, in 1787. notable moons – miranda, titania, ariel, umbriel & oberonother moons – cordelia, ophelia, bianca, cressida, desdemona, juliet, portia, rosalind, cupid, belinda, perdita, puck, mab, francisco, caliban, stephano, trinculo, sycorax, margaret, prospero, setebos & ferdinandneptune has at least 14 moons.
enceladus is the sixth-largest moon of saturn and, after titan, one of the most-studied worlds in the system.
titan is the saturn’s largest moon and is the second largest moon in our solar system.
if it were not orbiting saturn, titan could be considered a planet as it is larger than mercury.
titan is covered with a thick atmosphere that some consider to be similar to that of early earth.
