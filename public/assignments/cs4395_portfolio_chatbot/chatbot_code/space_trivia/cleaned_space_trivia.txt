Also, the moon’s gravitational force is only 17% that of Earth’s gravitational force. This means that a person who can jump 10 feet on Earth can jump almost 60 feet on the moon! 
- - What is the largest crater on Earth’s moon?
  - The South Pole-Aitken basin. It is an impact crater that is the largest, deepest, and oldest crater on the moon. The South Pole-Aitken basin is also the largest known crater in our Solar System. The crater is 1, 600 miles in diameter and 8. 1 miles deep in some areas. 
- - What are the dimensions in inches of the first footprint on Earth’s moon?
  - 13 by 6 inches. The footprint was left by Neil Armstrong during the Apollo 11 mission in Apollo 11 was the first space flight that landed humans on the moon. It also ended the Space Race between the Soviet Union and the United States of America. 
- - What flavor ice cream did Baskin-Robbins release in 1969 to commemorate America’s landing on the moon?
