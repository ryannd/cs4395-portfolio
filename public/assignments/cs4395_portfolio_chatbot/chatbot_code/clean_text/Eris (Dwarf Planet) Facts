eris is the most distant dwarf planet from the sun and has the greatest mass.
eris is the second largest dwarf planet (very a close second to pluto) and at one point was considered for the position of the 10th planet.
eris’ discovery promoted discussion that eventually lead to the classification of ‘dwarf planets’.
