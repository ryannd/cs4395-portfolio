The Whirlpool Galaxy is a familiar one to stargazers and among the many close galaxy neighbours to our own Milky Way. Because of its shape, it was the first galaxy to be classified as a spiral by astronomers. Today, it interests astronomers due to its spiral structure and the interaction it appears to be having with its near neighbour, M51b.
